# Decisions Log

Keep this short: what we decided, and why.

## Decisions

- 2026-02-07: Chose shadcn/ui as default UI layer for speed + consistency.
- 2026-02-07: State strategy = TanStack Query (server) + Zustand (UI/client).
- YYYY-MM-DD: <Add decisions as they happen>

## UI system choice (per project)

- Default: shadcn/ui
- Allowed alternative: Tailwind UI (copy components into repo), but must be declared in the UI System section of `AGENTS.md`.
