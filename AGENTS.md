# Agent Instructions

This is a vibecoding template for AI-assisted development.

## Before writing any code

1. Read `docs/outline.md` — this is the scope lock. Only build what is listed there.
2. Read `docs/plan.md` — this is the phased implementation plan.
3. Check `docs/screenshots/` and `docs/moodboard/` for visual references. If images are present, use them as inspiration for layout, styling, and visual direction. If the directories are empty, skip this step and use your best judgment.

---

## Rules

### 1. Scope & Guardrails (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Do not add features that are not explicitly described in `docs/outline.md`.
- If you believe a feature is missing, STOP and ask:
  "This is not in outline. Add it? (Yes/No)".
- Implement the single smallest next task only.
- Avoid big rewrites. Avoid multi-feature PRs.
- Before making changes, state which section + bullet in `docs/outline.md` this supports. If none → STOP and ask.
- Do not add libraries unless needed for the current task. Ask before adding any new dependency.

### 2. Tech Stack

**Default stack:**

- React + Vite + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TanStack Query for server state
- Zustand for client/UI state

**Optional (ask first):**

- React Router (if multi-page routes needed)
- Zod (validation)
- React Hook Form (forms)
- Sonner / toast library (UX)

**Not allowed without explicit approval:**

- Switching frameworks (no Next.js unless explicitly requested)
- Switching state approach (no Redux, MobX, etc.)
- Adding UI libraries besides shadcn/ui or Tailwind UI approach

### 3. UI System

- Default: shadcn/ui components in `src/components/ui/*`
- Use Tailwind tokens / CSS variables consistent with shadcn setup.
- Prefer composing shadcn primitives rather than custom one-off UI.
- If Tailwind UI is used instead, copy components into `src/components/twui/*` and treat them as owned code.
- Pick one approach per project (default shadcn). If you must mix, document it in `docs/decisions.md`.

### 4. Architecture & Structure

**Project structure:**

- `src/components/` for reusable UI
- `src/components/ui/` for shadcn components
- `src/features/<feature>/` for feature slices:
  - `components/`
  - `api/` (query hooks, request functions)
  - `state/` (zustand store if needed)
  - `types.ts`
  - `index.ts`

**State boundaries:**

- TanStack Query: anything server-backed (fetching, caching, mutations)
- Zustand: UI state (dialogs, filters, selections) and non-server client state

**Data fetching:**

- No fetching directly in random components.
- Use dedicated query hooks: `useXQuery`, `useYMutation`.

**Error/loading states:**

- Every data-driven UI must handle: loading, error, and empty state (if relevant).

**Naming conventions:**

- Components: PascalCase
- Hooks: useXxx
- Files: kebab-case or PascalCase, but be consistent

### 5. Quality

- Use Vitest + Testing Library. Prefer behavior-based tests. Critical flows should have tests.
- Interactive elements must be keyboard accessible. Inputs must have labels. Dialogs must manage focus.
- Run lint + format before checkpoint commits. Keep imports tidy.
- Avoid unnecessary global state. Avoid re-fetching loops. Memoize only when needed.

### 6. Commits & Checkpoints

- Commit after each small, working improvement. If something breaks, revert to last checkpoint.
- Commit message style: `chore:`, `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- Do not leave the repo in a failing state on main.
- Before commit: tests pass (or explain why not), app runs locally.

## Stack

- React + Vite + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (v4, no tailwind.config — uses `@theme inline` in `src/index.css`)
- shadcn/ui components in `src/components/ui/`
- TanStack Query for server state
- Zustand for UI/client state
- Vitest + Testing Library for tests

## Project structure

```
src/
  components/ui/    # shadcn/ui primitives (do not modify without reason)
  features/<name>/  # feature slices: components/, api/, state/, types.ts
  hooks/            # shared custom hooks
  lib/              # shared utilities
  test/             # test setup
docs/
  outline.md        # scope lock — the single source of truth
  plan.md           # phased implementation plan
  decisions.md      # architecture decision log
  prompts.md        # reusable prompts for AI tools
  QUICKSTART.md     # setup + commands
  screenshots/      # UI inspiration images
  moodboard/        # visual direction assets
```

## Workflow

1. Read `docs/outline.md` and `docs/plan.md`.
2. Propose the next single smallest task.
3. Before coding: cite which exact bullet in the outline it supports.
4. If the task involves UI, review `docs/screenshots/` and `docs/moodboard/` for visual direction. If empty, use your best judgment.
5. Implement without adding features not in the outline.
6. After coding: run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` to verify.
7. Suggest a checkpoint commit message.

## Documentation discipline

- If the plan changes, update `docs/plan.md`.
- If a tool/approach choice changes, update `docs/decisions.md`.
